[![Build Status](https://alfred.elifesciences.org/buildStatus/icon?job=prod-pattern-library)](https://alfred.elifesciences.org/job/prod-pattern-library/)
# Note
This pattern library uses as its starting point `https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php` with HEAD at sha e52ced8551000b7c6b97a01f419e2af8a07e2fd1

# Quickstart

This sets up PatternLab to generate the html from mustache templates, and make to handle transformation
of scss to css, and other various build-related tasks. Note that artefacts generated from running make targets 
are inputs for the generation of PatternLab files, so these need to run before PatternLab. When developing,
itâ€™s recommended to run watch tasks for both, which will take care of this.

## 1. Dependencies
You'll need:

* You have installed version 7.3.x of [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
* You have installed version 16.x of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* You have installed a recent version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## 2. Automatic setup
From the root directory run
```
$ make
```
or to automatically rebuild assets:
```
$ make watch
```
This will build the assets into the public folder and share it with a docker image containing a web server on port 8889 by default (can be adjusted by setting the env variable PORT).
You should be good to go, open your browser and navigate to [localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889) and you will see the pattern lab.

# Manual setup

## 1. Set up PatternLab

- Clone pattern library: `git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/pattern-library.git`
- Create the public folder: `cd pattern-library && mkdir public`
- Copy dependencies: `cp -r ./core/styleguide ./public/`

## 2. Build assets

- Install required npm packages with `make node_modules`
- Run `make public` to build the css, js, font, and image files.
- When generating files intended for website production, invoke with the production environment variable, like this: `ENVIRONMENT=production make public`. The minifies css & js files.

# Running tests

```
make test
```

will run the unit tests.

# Notes

All assets paths in Mustache templates must be wrapped in `{{#assetRewrite}}`, which allows implementations to rewrite the path for cache-busting purposes. The path must also be prepended by `{{assetsPath}}`.
