[![Build Status](https://alfred.elifesciences.org/buildStatus/icon?job=prod-pattern-library)](https://alfred.elifesciences.org/job/prod-pattern-library/)
# Note
This pattern library uses as its starting point  `https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php` with HEAD at sha e52ced8551000b7c6b97a01f419e2af8a07e2fd1

# Quickstart

This sets up PatternLab to generate the html from mustache templates, and make to handle transformation
of scss to css, and other various build-related tasks. Note that artefacts generated from running make targets 
are inputs for the generation of PatternLab files, so these need to run before PatternLab. When developing,
itâ€™s recommended to run watch tasks for both, which will take care of this.

## 1. Dependencies
You'll need:

* You have installed version 7.3.x of [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
* You have installed version 16.x of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* You have installed a recent version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## 2. Automatic setup
From the root directory run
```
$ make
```
This will build the assets into the public folder and share it with a docker image containing a web server on port 8080.
You should be good to go, open your browser and navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you will see the pattern lab.

# Manual setup

## 1. Set up PatternLab

- Clone pattern library: `git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/pattern-library.git`
- Create the public folder: `cd pattern-library && mkdir public`
- Copy dependencies: `cp -r ./core/styleguide ./public/`

## 2. Build assets

- Install required npm packages with `make node_modules`
- Run `make public` to build the css, js, font, and image files.
- Run `make watch` to watch for changes to the assets and rebuild them when detected.
- Run `make test` to run the tests.
- When generating files intended for website production, invoke with the production environment variable, like this: `ENVIRONMENT=production make public`. The minifies css & js files.

## 3. Generate PatternLab

To run a **one-off** generation of the patterns, it's `php ./core/builder.php -g`

Alternatively to set up a **watch task** for pattern generation, run `php ./core/builder.php -w` 

## 4. Verify the setup

The static files defining the patterns should now be available in the `public` directory.

Verify the generated static site by serving the `public` folder locally. One quick and dirty way to do this is to run the built in PHP server in the public folder:

  1. Open a new terminal
  2. `cd` into the `public` directory
  3. run the webserver `php -S localhost:8889`
  4. in a browser go to `http://localhost:8889` and verify you can see the generated patterns.

# Using patterns

For patterns that are being exposed as resources (ie the Mustache template can be used in an application), there is a YAML file located alongside the template. This contains details of any CSS files that it requires, and a JSON Schema that documents what input is expected.

You can run `bin/validate`, which checks all data files for a pattern against the schema.

There is also a list of js file dependencies for each pattern, but individual js files have not yet been implemented and so these lists are currently all empty.

# Running tests

```
make test
```

will run the unit tests.

# Notes

All assets paths in Mustache templates must be wrapped in `{{#assetRewrite}}`, which allows implementations to rewrite the path for cache-busting purposes. The path must also be prepended by `{{assetsPath}}`.
